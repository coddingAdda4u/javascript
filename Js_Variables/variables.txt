In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that you can use and manipulate later in your program. Think of a variable as a labeled container where you can store information like numbers, text, or other types of data.

Rules for variable
1. Variable names can include letters, numbers, $, and _, but cannot start with a number.
2. Use meaningful names to make your code easier to understand.

Note - variable names are case sensitive name and Name are two different variables.

How to declare variables
1. Using var keyword (old method) - Avoid var unless you’re working with older JavaScript code.
2. Using let keyword - Use let for variables that will change.
3 Using const keyword - Use const for variables that won’t change.
