JavaScript Operators

JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values or variables. Hereâ€™s a summary of the main types of operators:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic mathematical operations.
       +  (Addition): Adds two values.
          (Subtraction): Subtracts one value from another.
       *  (Multiplication): Multiplies two values.
       /  (Division): Divides one value by another.
       %  (Modulus): Returns the remainder of a division.
       **  (Exponentiation): Raises a value to the power of another.

2. **Assignment Operators**: Assign values to variables.
       = : Assigns a value.
       += : Adds and assigns.
        = : Subtracts and assigns.
       *= : Multiplies and assigns.
       /= : Divides and assigns.

3. **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean.
       == : Equal to.
       === : Strict equal (checks value and type).
       != : Not equal.
       !== : Strict not equal.
       < ,  > ,  <= ,  >= : Less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to.

4. **Logical Operators**: Combine or invert boolean values.
       && : Logical AND.
       || : Logical OR.
       ! : Logical NOT.

5. **Bitwise Operators**: Perform operations on binary representations.
       & ,  | ,  ^ : AND, OR, XOR.
       ~ : NOT.
       << ,  >> ,  >>> : Left shift, right shift, zero fill right shift.

6. **String Operators**: Work with strings.
       + : Concatenates strings.
       += : Appends to a string.

7. **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand.
       + : Converts to a number.
         : Negates a number.
       ++ : Increments by 1.
          : Decrements by 1.
       typeof : Returns the type of a variable.

8. **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for  if else .
       condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse .

These operators are fundamental to writing JavaScript code and are used in almost every program.
